# MyTravelHelper
This is an application to show next trains for an Irish Rail Company between 2 stations 

# Goals:
▪ Fix any code compilation issues 
▪ There are a number of issues in code that can cause issues, can you find them and fix them
▪ Need to cover Interactor with unit tests.
▪ We want to replace AlamoFire with plain UrlSession, can you refactor code to not depend on AlamoFire.
▪ We want the user to have the ability to save a station as a favourite.
The favourite station should display on the main screen and be selectable either as a 'Source' or a 'Destination' for the search.
Could you add this functionality in the application. 

## All code should be:
▪ Clean and readable code.
▪ Follow Good Coding practices.
▪ Factor in code reusability, code as if this was a much bigger project.
